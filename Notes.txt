- Command to create a new folder
    nest new projectName

---------------------------------------------Files
-.prettierrc = Give format to the code consistently
-nest-cli = Allow us to override or add some configuration specific to the project
-tsconfig.build = Basically, this is for prod mode, due to here we can override some rules and
    it could reduce the bundle size
---------------------------------------------Nest Modules
Each app has at leat one module (root or main module). It is the starting point of the app
Modules are effective if they are organized by components, also, it is good to have a folder per module
They are singletong (this is a pattern), which means that a module could be imported by others

Module = It is a class with the decorator @Module, this decorator provides meta-data that is used by
    Nest to organized the app structure
    @Module = Provide
        -Providers: Array of providers to be available within the module via dependency injection
        -Controllers: Array of controllers instantiated
        -Exports: Array of providers to export modules
        -Imports: List of modules required by the current module

----------------------Creating a module or controller
-nest [g] [module/controller] [name] [--no-spec]
    -g = generate
    -option = Could be replace by another option, see more option typing nest g --help
        -module, it will generate a new folder an update app.module
        -controller, it will 
    -name = name of the option, for this case, it is the module name
    -no-spec = it means that spec files won't be created

---------------------------------------------Nest Controllers
Responsible for handling inconming requests and returning responses to the client
Bound to a specific path
Containg handlers, which handle endpoints and reques methods (get, post, put delete)
Can take advantage of dependency injection to consume providers with same module

Controller = It has methods inside it, which each of it has decorator such as @GET, @POST...
